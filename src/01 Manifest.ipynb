      "### Starting point\n",
      "\n",
      "Currently there is documented and elaborated need for improving mathematical education, in particular in STEM areas (see, for example interesting, elaboration in [[1]][1]).  The key\n",
      "observation is that the pressure on math education, and STEM education in general, is constantly mounting, in particular in the cuntries with strong need for STEM workforce. This is, for example, made clear in the\n",
      "* [PISA](http://www.oecd.org/pisa/) surveys and\n",
      "* industry requests\n",
      "\n",
      "The basic reasons for learning math can be summarized as\n",
      "* an ability to perform tech jobs\n",
      "* an ability to have high quality everyday living\n",
      "* the development of logic(al) thinking for other areas\n",
      "\n",
      "A complete real-world math (and more general, science and engineering) knowledge would be comprised of four components:\n",
      "1. __Defining__ of the real-world problem\n",
      "2. __Modeling__ and translation of the problem into math\n",
      "3. __Computating__ - solving the math problem\n",
      "4. __Interpreting__ the solution - application to the real-world\n",
      "\n",
      "Currently, there is obvious disproportion of the time spent on each of these steps. Although there are lively discussion about needs and means to change the education, it is clear that pupils and students at lower levels spend most of the time (in the course of many years) on item 3., while other items are neglected. It can be argued that for many instances of the __Computation__, computers (computer algebra systems, programing languages, etc.) can be used as very successful tools, freeing sufficient study time to access other items better. Even though such efforts are not welcome for the entire population, it is non-arguable that certain steps in this direction need to be taken.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Notebooks and Cloud\n",
      "\n",
      "There is considerable effort to do so. Notebook principle introduced in [Mathematica](http://www.mathematica.com) or\n",
      "[IPython](http://ipython.org), computing in the cloud like [WolframAlpha](http://www.wolframalpha.com/) or [JuliaBox](http://juliabox.org) hosted by [Amazon Web Services](http://aws.amazon.com/), or other solutions like [geogebra](http://geogebra.org), enable teachers and others to quickly create efficient, illustrative and interactive materials which have a great potential to enhance learning and teaching experience, speed up the acquisition of knowledge and respond well to the existing needs.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Crowdsourcing\n",
      "\n",
      "The creation of (unofficial) math instruction materials is being intensively __crowdsourced__. Good examples are Wolfram's Mathematica Notebooks, [Computable Document Format](http://www.wolfram.com/cdf/?source=nav) and Alpha, and geogebra's [apps](http://web.geogebra.org/app/), written by many\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "> The next step is to combine (and formalize) crowdsourcing with state-of-the art collaborative (open source) code development systems like [github](https://github.com/), and include much more stakeholders (other teachers, users, industry experts and students) in the course creation.\n",
      "\n",
      "> All stakeholders (teachers, students, employers) should have an opportunity to __directly__ contribute to the course design.\n",

      "\n",
      "Massive open-online courses, such as those produced and managed on [Coursera](http://coursera.org), [edX](http://edx.org) or its subset [MITx](https://www.edx.org/school/mitx/allcourses), are an intensive development in education, made possible by the current development of Internet technologies.\n",

      "\n",
      "\n",
      "The courses, although produced by the world-class faculty, currently ensure neither broad enough base of stakeholders involved in the course creation, nor is the content sufficiently interactive, and, therefore, do not yet respond well to the existing needs <sup><a name=\"fni1\" href=\"#fn1\">1</a></sup>.\n",
