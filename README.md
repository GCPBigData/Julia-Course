Julia-Course
============

##  Welcome to the wonderful world of 21st+  century computation!

To understand why to learn and use and get a quick idea what it is all about, please read the section 
[Why Julia (Julia for Numerical Computation in MIT Courses)](https://github.com/stevengj/julia-mit/blob/master/README.md#why-julia).

To understand the concepts behindd the creation of the course, read the [Manifest](Manifest.ipynb).

### Julia features

* Julia is _fast_
* Julia is _open_
* Programs are easy to profile
* It is easy to construct and use _types_
* _Mutliple dispatch_
* Operators and function can be _overloaded_
* It is easy to use _multidimensional arrays_
* Using packages
* Writing your packages (on [github](https://github.com))
* Julia has many plotting environments
* Interfacing to other languages is easy
* Writing interfaces to other software packages (like [LAPACK](http://www.netlib.org/lapack)) is easy
* Julia can be used without installing it ([JuliaBox](http://juliabox.org))
* In Julia you can use the [python's](https://www.python.org/) strength, like [IPython notebook](http://ipython.org/) or symbolic computing from [sympy](http://sympy.org/en/index.html)
* Interactivity is simple - [@manipulate](https://github.com/JuliaLang/Interact.jl)
* Web accesss is easy
* Manipulating big data is easy ([HDF5](http://www.hdfgroup.org/HDF5/))
* Julia is great to use in [teaching](http://julialang.org/teaching/) and [grading](https://github.com/jupyter/nbgrader)

### What will you learn
All of the above and more!

_And, the most important, Julia lets you learn and grow individually!_ [_(Alan Edelman)_](http://www-math.mit.edu/~edelman/index.php)

### Technology

The course is written exclusively as [IPython](http://ipython.org/) ([IJulia](https://github.com/JuliaLang/IJulia.jl) notebooks.
The notebooks can be:
* viewed using the [IPython notebook viewer](http://nbviewer.ipython.org/),
* downloaded an executed on your computer (after installing the necessary packages) as described in [Installation](Installation.ipynb), or
* executed in Amazon Cloud using [JuliaBox](https://juliabox.org/)

In all three cases, the graphical interface is simply your web browser.

The problem set notebooks are automatically graded.

### Credits

The course is based upon work of many, credits will be given along the way. The course was started during Ivan Slapnicar's visit to Julia Group at [MIT](http://www.mit./edu) under the [Fulbright-Schuman International Educator Grant](http://www.fulbrightschuman.eu/).
